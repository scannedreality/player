### ScannedReality Player Library - WebXR example ###

This example demonstrates how to display an XRVideo in AR or VR using WebXR.

Please notice: At the time of writing, browser support for WebXR was still very limited.
The example was tested with Chrome on Android and with the Meta Quest Browser on Meta Quest 2.
iOS did not support WebXR yet.
